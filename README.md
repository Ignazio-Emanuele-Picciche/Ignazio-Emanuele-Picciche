I am very determined, flexible, optimistic and curious. Through my previous experiences I am able to face and resolve problems of various kinds with determination. I can work in a team putting others at ease and respecting their spaces for action. Also I am able to work in stressful situations, organizing work effectively.I am very determined, flexible, optimistic and curious.
